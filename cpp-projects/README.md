# C++ Programming Concepts – Coursework by Elijah Morales 💻📘

This repository showcases all programming work completed in my **Programming Concepts (C++)** course. It includes structured exercises, logical programs, and simulations that demonstrate foundational and intermediate C++ programming techniques. The projects focus on real-world logic and modular design using functions, control structures, arrays, pointers, and object simulation.

## 🧠 Learning Reflection

Through this course, I developed confidence in:
- Decomposing real-world tasks into logical program flow
- Applying structured C++ techniques for data manipulation
- Writing modular code with reusability and clarity in mind

Projects like the **Retail Sales Assistant** and **Card Trick Simulator** challenged my ability to use control flow, loops, and arrays together in engaging simulations.
